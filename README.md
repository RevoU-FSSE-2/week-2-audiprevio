# ZERONE Website

Welcome to the official repository of ZERONE, a net-zero ride-hailing application. ZERONE is a forward-thinking, environmentally conscious solution to modern transport, leveraging Tesla's all-electric fleet for an unmatched user experience.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a keen focus on responsive design to ensure an optimized experience across various devices.

## SECTION 1: PROJECT STRUCTURE

The website consists of several key components detailed below:

### Navigation Bar (`navbar`)

The top navigation bar is an essential part of the website, providing easy access to critical areas of the site. Links include the home page, sign-in page, services, contact us, and about pages. A hamburger icon triggers the responsive navigation menu for smaller screens, handled through a JavaScript function.

### Hero Section (`Hero`)

The hero section serves as an engaging introduction to ZERONE, featuring compelling headers and subtexts. Two distinct call-to-action (CTA) buttons invite potential drivers to join the service and customers to book their ride instantly.

### About Us (`aboutus-text-section`)

This section dives into ZERONE's value proposition, explaining the benefits for users and how ZERONE's approach contributes to a sustainable future. A tertiary CTA button here invites users to learn more about the service.

### Side Image Section (`sideimage-container`)

Here, relevant imagery adds visual interest and supplements the textual content. It helps to engage users, providing a visual representation of the written content.

### Video Section (`content-container-video`)

In this section, an embedded YouTube video provides a dynamic look at the ZERONE fleet, highlighting the luxury, safety, and environmental benefits of our all-Tesla fleet.

### Photo Grid Section (`photo-grid`)

This section employs a grid layout to display various high-quality images of the ZERONE Tesla fleet, showcasing the vehicles that users will ride in when they choose our service.

### Contact Form (`form-container-section`)

Finally, we offer a comprehensive contact form where interested visitors can leave their details and inquiries. The form fields include First Name, Last Name, Email, Nationality, Related Service, and a text area for detailed messages.
